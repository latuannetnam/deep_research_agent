These tasks would likely run in a sequential manner, where the output of one task becomes the input (context) for the next.

**Task 1: Define Research Scope & Plan**
    *   **Description:** Based on the initial user-provided topic `"{topic}"`, clarify the core research question(s), define the desired scope and depth (e.g., historical overview, current state, future trends, specific aspects). Break down the main topic into 3-5 specific sub-questions or areas of focus for the search agents. Define the expected structure of the final report.
    *   **Agent:** Research Manager
    *   **Expected Output:** A structured research plan document including:
        *   Clarified main research question(s).
        *   List of specific sub-questions/areas to investigate.
        *   Keywords and potential search angles for each sub-question.
        *   Definition of the desired output format and key sections for the final report.
        *   Any specific constraints (e.g., focus on a particular time period or region).

**Task 2: Broad Web Information Gathering**
    *   **Description:** Using the research plan from Task 1, search the general web for information relevant to the specified sub-questions.

**Task 8: Final Review (Optional but Recommended)**
    *   **Description:** Review the final report generated in Task 7 against the original Research Plan from Task 1. Check for completeness (were all sub-questions addressed?), accuracy (does the report accurately reflect the synthesis?), clarity, and overall quality. Ensure citations are present.
    *   **Agent:** Research Manager
    *   **Context:** Final Report from Task 7. Research Plan from Task 1.
    *   **Expected Output:** The approved final research report, possibly with minor edits or a note confirming it meets the requirements. (In a more complex setup, this could trigger a revision loop).

**Workflow & Implementation Notes:**

*   **Process:** This design implies a `Process.sequential` workflow in CrewAI.
*   **Context Passing:** CrewAI's context mechanism is crucial. The output of each task (e.g., the research plan, the source lists, the synthesis) must be passed as context to the subsequent tasks that depend on it.
*   **Tools:** You'll need to integrate appropriate tools, especially robust web search tools (like `SerperDevTool`, `DuckDuckGoSearchRun`, etc.) and potentially website scraping tools (`ScrapeWebsiteTool`). Custom tools might be needed for specific database interactions if feasible.
*   **LLM Choice:** The effectiveness will depend heavily on the underlying LLM's ability to plan, search strategically, evaluate critically, synthesize complex information, and write coherently. GPT-4 or similar powerful models are recommended.
*   **Error Handling:** Consider adding basic error handling or fallback mechanisms within tasks (e.g., if a search tool fails).
*   **Iteration:** Real-world research is often iterative. This linear design is a starting point. More advanced versions could incorporate feedback loops (e.g., if the Evaluator finds insufficient high-quality sources, it could prompt the searchers to refine their queries).

This detailed design should provide a solid foundation for building your DeepSearch multi-agent system using CrewAI. Remember to adapt tool names and specific implementation details based on the CrewAI library version and available tool integrations.
